description="The core of this plugin is the `Zone` system, a powerful area manager that lets you build diverse game mechanics by combining different logic modules:

- Permission Control (`ZonePermission`): Governs which objects are allowed to enter a specific zone.
- Layout Management (`ZoneLayout`): Manages how objects are arranged, featuring built-in Arc, Pile, and Horizontal layouts.
- Display Logic (`ZoneDisplay`): Controls the visual appearance of objects, including hover effects, selection states, and more.
- Interaction Handling (`ZoneInteraction`): Processes user input like clicks, drags, and multi-selection.
- Sorting Logic (`ZoneSort`): Defines the automatic sorting order for objects within a zone.
